<p>This application is designed to triage emergency patients based on priority using artificial intelligence, relying on inputs such as heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, and accompanying symptoms.</p>
<p>After entering the information â€” either for a list of patients or a single patient â€” the AI analyzes the data and classifies the patient&rsquo;s condition as critical, highly critical, or non-critical.</p>
<p>The patient&rsquo;s data is then stored in a database with sensitive information encrypted, and made available to supervisors responsible for admitting patients in the emergency department.<br></p>
