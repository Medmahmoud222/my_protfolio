### ðŸ›’ AI Triage System  
This application is designed to triage emergency patients based on priority using artificial intelligence, relying on inputs such as heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, and accompanying symptoms.

After entering the information â€” either for a list of patients or a single patient â€” the AI analyzes the data and classifies the patient's condition as critical, highly critical, or non-critical.

The patient's data is then stored in a database with sensitive information encrypted, and made available to supervisors responsible for admitting patients in the emergency department.<br>
